Tommy To-Do List
by Lucas Arcoverde
version 1.27.1.26

OVERVIEW
--------

TOMMY is a simple to-do list program for command-line-interfaces (CLI).
I made the app while learning C programming, therefore, it will not be the best program in the world, and probally there will be a few mistakes in the code.
Someone may be wondering why i choose the name "Tommy" for the project, and there is a reason that i like to explain:

I started with a simple generic name for a simple app, just like "To-Do App",
then i started playing with the words To-Do.
So i got things like ToDo, then Toddo, then Toddy, and finally, Tommy.
That is how i like to name my own things, giving it a personal touch.

Also i am glad to say i finish this project wtih ALMOST NOTHING AI use. There is no code written directly by AI, just used it one time for checking for erros when i was finishing the project.

And you may notice my git skills are none.

FEATURES
--------

TOMMY can:
* Add a task to a list;
* Remove a task from a list;
* Update a task from your list;
* View your list.

At this moment (v1.x) it only have these few features, but i am considering expand with things like multiple lists, implement a TUI and et cetera.

As i said before, i made it just for learning, so donot take it seriously.
